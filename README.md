# Storytelling with Data: NYC Restaurant Inspection Violations

Purpose

Restaurant grades do not capture a restaurant's full history of violations and the underlying scoring system obscures the specific nature of violations, some of which may be more troubling to an average restaurant-goer. This project attempts to examine restaurants' full history of violations related to improper food preparation and storage, the presence of pests (such as rats, flies or cockroaches), and inadequate or unclean toilet facilities.
